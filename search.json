The required dual resonating frequencies being 2.45GHz and 5.8GHz respectively.\nSeveral micro strip arrays were designed in ADS keysight software; two separate 4x1 arrays which resonate at 2.45GHz and 5.8GHz respectively, which were then combined through the use of rectangular stubs into a 2x4 array which resonates at both frequencies. The combined antenna array was then fabricated on campus at Heriot-watt university and subsequently experimentally tested for its S11 and far-field parameters to evaluate it’s performance.\n\n\nDesign\n\nArray design parameters\nBoth 4x1 arrays were combined to form a 4x2 array which resonates at dual frequencies 2.45GHz and 5.8GHz. In order to combine the individual arrays, rectangular shunt stubs were used to match the characteristic impedance’s of both arrays’ respective feed lines. Stubs act as a DC open circuit and an RF short circuit corresponding to the 4/\\(\\lambda\\) length of the particular resonating frequency.\n\n\nQuarter wave transformers\nBy placing the stubs \\(\\lambda\\)/4 distance of of the opposite resonating frequency in parallel along the transmission line, (with the distances being 30.59 mm and 12.92 mm respectively) and setting length of the stubs to be \\(\\lambda\\)/4 of the corresponding resonating frequency(with the lengths of the shunt stubs being 12.92mm and 30.59mm respectively) they can be used to effectively short circuit the transmission lines leading to either the 2.45GHz array or the 5.8GHz array depending on the resonating frequency and act as an open circuit depending on the resonating frequency; this allowing current to flow to only one of the 4x1 arrays. This allows both arrays to resonate independently of each other at their intended frequencies without the need for any external components such as a switch to manually operate the array.\n \n\n\nFinal Combined Design\nShown below is the layout of the final combined antenna array design, with rectangular stubs used to match both individual arrays.\n \n\n\n\nResults\nThe simulated results shown below were obtained using ADS keysight for the S11 parameters and Momentum for the Far Field parameters. To model the complex behavior of microwave circuits, ADS uses an approach called Method of Moments (MoM). MoM extrapolates observations in order to make some prediction, and can be used to solve deterministic or eigenvalue problems.\n\n\n\nSim_results\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-thread GUI Traffic road system simulation - Java \n\nProject requirements\n\n\nUML\n\nVehicle class\n\n\nVehicle.java\n\npublic class Vehicle extends Thread{\n\n    private String numberPlate;\n    private int crossTime;\n    private int direction; \n    private Boolean crossingStatus;\n    private int length;\n    private int segment; \n    private int emissionsPerSecond; \n    private String vehicleType;\n    private long initialisationTime;\n    private long crossingStatusTime;\n    private Boolean isGreen = false;\n    private Phase phase;\n\n    public Vehicle(String numberPlate, String vehicleType, int crossTime, int direction, int length, int emissionsPerSecond ,\n            Boolean crossingStatus, int segment, Phase phase)  throws PlateNumberFormatException {\n\n                /*\n                    Constructor Exception handling\n                */\n\n            }\n\n            /*\n            Class methods\n            */\n\n}\n\n\n\nGUI\nSimplified gui code to illustrate how each Swing JComponent was used and integrated to build the window structure, additionally there is also an example of event handling within the gui.\n\n\nGui.java\n\npublic Gui(Intersection intersection) {\n\n    this.intersection = intersection;\n\n    //Main window\n    JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"Intersection\");\n    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);\n    frame.setSize(1280, 720);\n    frame.getContentPane().setLayout(new MigLayout(\"\", \"[1254px]\", \"[672px]\"));\n\n    //.....\n\n    //Used for navigation between pages\n    JTabbedPane tabbedPane = new JTabbedPane(JTabbedPane.BOTTOM);\n\n    //General Information tab\n    JPanel genInfoPane = new JPanel();\ntabbedPane.addTab(\"General Information\", null, genInfoPane, null);\n\n    //......\n\n        //ScrollPane to contain the laneTable\n    JScrollPane scrollPane2 = new JScrollPane();\n    genInfoPane.add(scrollPane2, \"cell 1 1 1 2,growx,aligny top\");\n    \n    laneTable = new JTable();\n    laneTable.setModel(new DefaultTableModel(\n            new Object[][] {\n            },\n            new String[] {\n                \"Phase\", \"Lanes\", \"Duration\"\n            }\n        ) {\n            boolean[] columnEditables = new boolean[] {\n                false, false, false\n            };\n            public boolean isCellEditable(int row, int column) {\n                return columnEditables[column];\n            }\n        });\n\n    //......\n\n\n    //Example ActionListener implemented to handle ActionEvents and open a Pop-up\n    JButton newButton = new JButton(\"New\");\n    newButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n        }\n    });\n    newButton.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {\n        @Override\n        public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {\n            // Opens add vehicle pop-up\n            Add.mainGui(intersection);\n        }\n    });\n\n    //......\n\n    //Advanced Features tab\n    JScrollPane advFeaturesPane = new JScrollPane();\n\n    //......\n\n    //Export Settings tab\n    JPanel exportPane = new JPanel();\n    tabbedPane.addTab(\"Export settings\", null, exportPane, null);\n\n    //.....\n       \n}\n\n\n\nUnit Testing\nAn excerpt from one of the implemented unit tests, designed to capture all possible edge cases for a user inputted numberplate.

With each particle object having its own location vector, velocity vector, list of random informants and personal best; the location and velocity vector length was adaptable depending on number of dimensions, allowing flexibility of use/testing. The particle class also includes an informant update and personal best update functions for ease of readability and streamlining. A ring topology was used for the social element of the search, meaning each particle is only connected to its neighbours to avoid pre-mature convergence on local optima.\nThe implemented PSO algorithm was used to solve the CEC 2005 optproblems, which can be found at https://www.simonwessing.de/optproblems/doc/cec2005.html.\n\n\nParticle.py\n\n    #Particle object which contains random location and velocity \nclass Particle(object):\n    def __init__(self,index,n_informants):\n        self.index = index\n        #particles location, assigned randomly within the min and max bounds of specified function\n        self.loc = np.random.uniform(function.min_bounds, function.max_bounds,n_dimensions) \n        self.vel = np.zeros(n_dimensions) #Velocity vector (initally set to zero)\n        #initally assigning each particle randomly n_informants through an index in range of swarmsize\n        self.informants = np.random.randint(0,swarmsize-1,n_informants) \n        #sets the particles inital personal best as inital location\n        self.pbest = self.loc\n        \n    #updates the particle's informants(used each iteration)\n    def update_informants(self): \n        self.informants = np.random.randint(0,swarmsize-1,n_informants)\n\n    #updates each particles personal best\n    def update_pbest(self):\n        if (ideal - self.loc) &lt; (ideal - self.pbest):\n            self.pbest = self.loc\n\n\n\nPSO.py\n\n#Swarm list to contain these particle objects\nswarm = []\n\n#Populating swarm list with particle objects\nfor i in range(swarmsize):\n    swarm.append(Particle(i,n_informants))\n\n#finds global best value by creating a list of fitnesses for each particle, compares them all\ndef global_best(): \n\n#finds informant best value by creating a list of fitnesses for each particle, compares them all\ndef informant_best(x):\n\n#velocity update calculation, which takes personal best, informant best and global best into consideration\nswarm[j].vel[n] =alpha*swarm[j].vel[n] + b*(swarm[j].pbest[n] - xi)+c*(swarm[i_best].loc[n]-xi) +d*(swarm[best].loc[n]-xi)\n\n#updating each particles location with updated velocity\nswarm[k].loc = swarm[k].loc + E* swarm[k].vel\n\n\n\nGenetic Algorithm - Python \n\n\ngenetic_algorithm.py\n\n#Initializing random adult population vector\ndef initalize_population(POP_SIZE:int):\n    population = []\n    for i in range(POP_SIZE):\n        #creating population \n        population.append(np.random.randint(function.min_bounds, function.max_bounds,n_dimensions)) \n    return population\n\n#Return fitness value for each member of population in list\ndef assess_fitness(population:list):\n    population_fitness = []\n    for i in range(len(population)):\n        population_fitness.append(function(population[i])-ideal)\n    best = np.argmin(population_fitness)\n    return best\n\n#One point crossover of two parents to create 2 unique children\ndef one_point_crossover(vector_1, vector_2):\n    length = len(vector_1)\n    c = np.random.randint(1, length)\n    if c != 1:\n        for i in range(c, length):\n            vector_1[i] ,vector_2[i] = vector_2[i] ,vector_1[i]\n    return vector_1, vector_2"
